        <h1>Aobout Me</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; padding: 25px;">Hello everyone Pijush here, I am currently pursuing my B.Tech from BBIT and working with an ed-tech institute.
            I am passionate about web development, data science...With about 2 years of coding exoerience and year of experience
            as an online code instructor at ISR (Indian School of Robotics), Connectbud, I decided to set out on a 
            new journey with TechBridge to help guide young and ambitious minds on their path to becoming future coders.

    <div class="why", style=" text-align: center;">
        <h1>Why I chose this profession-</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; padding: 25px;">
            I started with a vision to make the students understand the concept of Coding as it helps them to develop an appreciation of how things work.
            It also teaches them how software engineers use math to solve problems logically and creatively.Coding brings out the best of problem solving
            capabilities in all.And each and every person have their own way of resolving a given issue.So as being a coder, it would be an ambitious opportunity
            to bring out the young talent to come forward and provide them with the knowledge about the tenchonology whichâ€™ll help them to build a career in future.
        </p>

    <div class="For the role" style=" text-align: center;">
        <h1>Why i fit in the project</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; padding: 25px;"> I wish to pursue this internship to evaluate my inherent abilities and potential. Although I have accumulated a strong foundational
            knowledge in this domain,
            I think the best way to move forward would be to get practical working experience in an established platform, that is your company.
            I wish to learn, upskill, and acquire skills that can shape me as a valued professional in this field.
